## About the Project

**Art Collection** is a responsive Single Page Application (SPA) built with **React** and **TypeScript**, designed to showcase artwork collections from the [Metropolitan Museum of Art's public API](https://metmuseum.github.io/). It leverages **React Hooks** with **Context API** for state management, and **Context API** for logic encapsulation. Built with scalability in mind, the project follows best practices of **component-driven architecture** and **SOLID principles**.

## Tech Stack

- **React 19**
- **React Router v7** (Routing)
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite** (Build tool)
- **Docker** (Deployment environment)
- **Framer Motion** (Animation)
- **Axios** (HTTP requests)
- **SASS (SCSS Modules)** (Styling)
- **Met Museum Public API** (Data source)

---

## Code Quality

- **Jest** + **React Testing Library** (Testing with 75% of coverage)
- **SonarQube** (Analyzes JavaScript/TypeScript source and test coverage reports on localhost)
- **Eslint** (Enforces consistent coding standards and detects problematic patterns)
- **Prettier** (Auto-formats your codebase for clean, readable style)

---

## Additional Packages

- `axios` — For API calls to the Met Museum
- `framer-motion` — Used for component transitions and few UI animations
